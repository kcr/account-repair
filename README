Configuring the Account Repair Wizard:

The wizard looks for files in the "actions" directory
(/usr/share/debathena-account-repair/actions) that end in .action.
These are INI files, similar to .desktop files, with this format:
  [AccountWizardAction]
  title=My First Action
  help=Some descriptive text about the action.  It can
   span multiple lines if intended by one space.  Line breaks
   are not honored.
  confirm=Some optional text to be displayed on the dialog presented
   to the user before they run the action.
  script=some-script-name

The script in 'script' must be in the "scripts" directory
(/usr/lib/debathena-account-repair/scripts) and may be any executable.
The script should exit with 0 to indicate success or nonzero to indicate
failure.  Upon exit, the contents of stdout will be displayed to the
user.  If the script exits with a non-zero statys, the contents of stderr
will be displayed as well.

$DISPLAY is not set and graphical applications should not be used.
